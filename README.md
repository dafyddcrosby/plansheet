# Plansheet

Plansheet is a simple to-do list generator program that creates a LaTeX
printout (that can be turned into a PDF by pdflatex) from a pile of formatted
[YAML](https://yaml.org) files.

Plansheet is still a work-in-progress, and while effort is made not to break over minor/patch versions, it's best effort. If you aren't comfortable with fixing Ruby using a lot of metaprogramming, check back in a year or two

## Installation

```ruby
gem install plansheet
```
## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
